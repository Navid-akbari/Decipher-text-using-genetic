    "The goal of this computer assignment is to get more familiar with the genetic algorithm for searching. This algorithm is used when we have a state explosion problem, and our space is very large. In this assignment, we try to decipher substitution cryptography. If we want to try all possible states, we should check $26!$ states, which is impossible. But with the genetic algorithm, we will solve this problem in a timely manner way."
